__Ideas for writing papers on GitHub__

Authors work on branches and accept pull requests. If code is involved, then there is the possibility of using Travis-CI to only accept pull requests that pass builds.

This process also allows for peer review while papers are in progress.

Pandoc: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/ is a fantastic tool that can be combined with `Make` to create documents in any output format including docx, pdf, latex.

Note: If you work with R, RStudio's IDE integrates Pandoc so you wont need to install separately. You can go from code to paper in one click.
